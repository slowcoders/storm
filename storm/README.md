# Storm

Storm is a ORM library. One of its key features is that it internally deals with concurrency and transaction issues 
so that developers using Storm do not have to care about those issues in multithreaded environment. 
For now, Storm is implemented on top of JDBC layer and it uses SQLite but new implementation
 with other databases can be provided in later updates.

Details on how to use Storm are explained in the tutorial
